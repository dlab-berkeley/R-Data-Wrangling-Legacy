We will dive into additional tools within the tidyverse to make data wrangling easier and more efficient. To that end, we will cover how to use our `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions within functions. In the process, we will gain insight into the tidy eval data-masking framework, how it works, and how to make it work for us. 

We will also see how to apply functions over multiple files with functional programming via the `purrr` package.
