# Data Wrangling and Manipulation in R

It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. This workshop will introduce tools (notably dplyr and tidyr) that makes data wrangling and manipulation much easier. Participants will learn how to use these packages to subset and reshape data sets, do calculations across groups of data, clean data, and other useful stuff.

**Prior knowledge**: Previous experience with (basic) R is helpful but not necessary. 

**Offered**: [UC Berkeley D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/data-wrangling-and-manipulation-r-6), October 30, 2018

## Setup

To participate in this workshop, you will need access to the software described below. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser. I recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). 

Once you've installed all of the software below, test your installation by following the instructions at the bottom on this page.

### R and RStudio

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

#### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Mac OS X

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Linux

You can download the [binary files](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html) for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

### Testing your installation

**How to download the workshop materials**

* Click the green “Clone or download” button  
* Click “Download Zip”  
* Extract the files some place convenient (i.e., Desktop)  
  * if you are a Git user, simply clone this repository  

Find the Tutorial.Rmd file in the directory you just downloaded and open it in RStudio. If all goes well, RStudio should launch and you should see the tutorial.
