## Exercise 1
##Create a new object called africa_asia that is filtered by “Africa” and “Asia”*. Select all variables except for gdpPercap. 
##Use the pipe operator to chain the functions together.

africa_asia_lifeExp <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa"& lifeExp < 60 | continent == "Asia" & lifeExp <60) %>%
  select(-gdpPercap)
  
## Exercise 2

#Use dplyr to create a data frame containing the median lifeExp for each country

median_country_lifeExp <- gapminder %>% group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(median_lifeExp = median(lifeExp))

## Exercise 3

#Use dplyr to add a column to the gapminder dataset that contains the 
#total population of the continent of each observation in a given year.

gapminder <- gapminder %>% group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  mutate(continent_pop = sum(pop))

gapminder <- gapminder %>%  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  mutate(mean_continent_gdp = mean(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercap_diff = gdpPercap - mean_continent_gdp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap_diff))
  
  ## Exercise 4
  
#Subset the results from the last exercise to select only the country, year, and gdpPercap_diff columns. 
#Use tidyr put it in wide format # so that countries are rows and years are columns. You might need to use  ungroup() before the select() function.
#Then turn the dataframe above back into the long format with three columns: country, year, and gdpPercap_diff.
  
gapminder_wide <- gapminder %>% ungroup() %>% select(country, year, gdpPercap_diff) %>% 
   spread(year, gdpPercap_diff)

gapminder_long <- gapminder_wide %>% gather(year, gdpPercap_diff, `1952`: `2007`)
